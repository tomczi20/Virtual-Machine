# Virtual-Machine
A Virtual Machine written in Java.
Starting from a simple bit containing a 1 or 0, positive and negative 32-bit numbers are built in the form of longwords.
A ripple adder is used to subtract and add longwords. The multiplier allows for the multiplication of two longwords. The CPU's memory is made up of a collection of 1024 bytes, each containing 8 bits. An assembler converts Assembly language into Machine language that is stored in the CPU's memory and executed.
